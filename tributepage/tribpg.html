                 <h2>Harvard's Mark 1</h2>
                 <p>Grace's first computer</p>
                 <p>1944</p>
                 <p>Built By IBM and operated at Harvard, Mark 1 programmer Grace Hopper and her colleagues assisted the U.S. war effort, performing mathematical calculations, even for the Manhattan Project. Using this electromechanical computer was much faster than calculating by hand, and resulted in more precise answers than slide rule (or competing computers).

                 <h2>Program Bugs</h2>
                 <p>One moth is all it took</p>
                 <p>1945</p>
                 <p>A "bug" is a common engineering term, but Grace Hopper is considered the originator of its application to programming. After she removed a dead moth from the Harvard Mark 1, she taped it to her notebook and labeled it as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_Computer_Bug,_1945.jpg" target="new" title="Harvard 1's bug" alt="Link to image of the Harvard 1 bug">first actual case of bug being found</a>".</p>

                 <h2>UNIVAC 1</h2>
                 <p>Early computing's poster child</p>
                 <p>1950</p>
                 <p>Designed to meet the needs of business, UNIVAC used magnetic tapes (initially) and vacuum tubes instead of punch-cards and mechanical mechanisms. It found fame by predicting Eisenhower's election as U.S. President with shocking accuracy. Hopper served as a senior mathematician at Remington Rand, who manufactured UNIVACs, and developed FLOW-MATIC for the machines.

                 <h2>FLOW-MATIC</h2>
                 <p>The first machine-independent programming language</p>
                 <p>1955</p>
                 <p>After years of working with highly technical minds, Hopper's goal at Remington Rand was to make it "easy for businessmen to use [the UNIVAC]". It took more than four years to develop an English-based programming language, and implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" target="new" title="Compiler, Wikipedia" alt="Link to Wikipedia page on Compilers">compiler</a>.</p>

                 <h2>COBOL</h2>
                 <p>Common Business-Oriented Language</p>
                 <p>1959</p>
                 <p>Heavily influenced by Hopper, her FLOW-MATIC language, and IBM and their COMTRAN language, the U.S. Dept. of Defense pushed for wide-spread adoption of COBOL after its development. By 1970, COBOL achieved world-wide adoption, and is still in use more than 50 years later.

                 <p>National Institute of Standards and Technology</p>
                 <p>1970's</p>
                 <p>During the 1970's Hopper advocated for the Defense Department's transition away from centralized computers to networked systems. She also worked to develop and implement testing standards for early programming languages, which were rolled into the NIST.</p>
