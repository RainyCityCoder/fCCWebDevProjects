        <p>Aperture Science Physics Department has miniaturized the technology originally deployed in the <code>Aperture Science Portable Quantum Tunneling Device</code> (ASPQTD). While revolutionary, the <code>ASPQTD</code> could only marginally be considered "human-portable", as its size and weight necessitated being worn on the back with appropriate load-bearing straps and harnessing. The <code>Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device</code> (ASHPD) brings quantum tunneling technology into the 21st-century. Weighing a fraction of the <code>ASPQTD</code>'s heft, and featuring numerous improvements, the <code>ASHPD</code> represents the finest in scientific discovery made useful.</p>

        <p>The <code>ASHPD</code> is a hand-held device which has the ability to manufacture two linked portals. The bi-directional, linked flat-plane portals allow matter and energy to pass between them regardless of the distance between linked portals. Any object which passes through one portal will emerge from the other, and vice versa, instantaneously. The object's speed, velocity, and momentum will be preserved, relative to the plane of each portal. </p>
      </section>
      <section id="operation" class="main-section">
        <header class="main-header">Operation</header>
        <p>Do not touch the operational end of the <code>ASHPD</code></p>
        <p>Do not look at the operational end of the <code>ASHPD</code></p>
        <p>Do not submerge the <code>ASHPD</code> in liquid, even partially.</p>
        <p> Portals can be placed on nearly any flat surface large enough that the portal doesn't extend beyond the surface's borders. The most effective surfaces are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refined Moon Rock</li>
          <li>Concrete</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Surfaces that do not support portals at all include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Biological Matter</li>
          <li>Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill</li>
          <li>Metal</li>
          <li>Any version of the Aperture Science Anti-Portal Tiles family of products</li>
          <li>Doors</li>
          <li>Windows</li>
          <li>Most moving surfaces, regardless of composition
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>ASHPD</code> is held with a hand behind the device, holding the handle/trigger, while the other hand supports the "barrel". A light in the small hole on the top of the ASHPD and its glowing glass tube both have the color of the last portal shot. It has two triggers, one for each of its two portals.</p>
    <p>When the <code>ASHPD</code> is fired, a burst of colored energy is emitted from the barrel, corresponding to the colored portal it is intended to create. Upon striking the targeted surface, a portal is formed, surrounded by a colored ring. If the surface cannot accommodate a portal for whatever reason, the shot will dissipate in a shower of colored particles. If one portal is shot into its opposite, the portal will be formed next to the first one, assuming the surface has enough room for it to form; otherwise, it will dissipate as normal. The device can only create two portals at a time. If a third is fired, the other of its type will be automatically closed and a new link will be formed. </p>
    <p>The oval-shaped crosshair/reticle of the ASHPD indicates useful information pertaining to the portals. The crosshair includes two portal indicators, one blue and one orange. When a portal has been fired and appears on an appropriate surface, a smaller oval appears next to the side that has been most recently fired, and when the ASHPD is held in front of a surface where portals cannot be shot, only the outlines of the two oval elements are seen. A filled-in outline indicates a suitable surface. </p>
    <p>It should be noted that portal shots cannot be shot through portals. When aimed at an open portal, only the part of the crosshair matching the color of the portal is filled.</p>

        <p>Repairs may be done through Aperture Science Authorized Repair Outlets, or by sending the unit directly to the Aperture Science Repair Division. Replacment parts may be obtained through authorized Aperture Science Dealers, or directly from Aperture Science. Replacement part lists are shipped with each <code>ASHPD</code>. No additional components are available as replacement parts. Please see the <a href="#end-of-life">End-of-Life section</a> of this document should components not available as replacement parts be needed.</p>
    <p>The <code>ASHPD</code> is powered by a miniature black hole, which is kept stable through the use of a cooling fan at the rear of the device. In case the black hole should begin to fail, two miniature German stick grenades, stored within the casing, can be used to restart it, by screwing them into two small holes in the device. </p>

        <header class="main-header">End-of-Life</header>
        <p>Should the cooling fan at the rear of the <code>ASHPD</code> fail, the device should be disassembled to retrieve the <code>Event Horizon Estimation Wheel</code>, which will determine the minimum safe distance to survive the resulting overload. It is highly recommended that this distance be treated as a minimum.</p>
    <p>If the <code>ASHPD</code> is damaged beyond the ability for replacement parts listed in the Replacement Parts List to restore the unit completely and fully, use of the device should be immediately terminated. Should disposal be necessary, please contact Aperture Science for instructions. Ensure unit serial number is available; instructions and warranty information will vary depending on model.</p>
